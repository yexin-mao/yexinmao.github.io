This paper proposes Graph Robust Contrastive Learning (GROC), a fully self-supervised graph algorithm aiming to achieve robustness to adversarial attacks. 

In this method, we first start by choosing a set of anchor nodes from the graph. Next, we apply two stochastic transformations that randomly mask node features to obtain two distinct views. The graph is reduced to the union of receptive fields of anchor nodes and their 1âˆ’hop neighborhoods. Then, we apply two adversarial transformations to these two views, removing and inserting edges based on gradient signals. Finally, through contrastive learning, we force the embeddings of each anchor node in both views together, and force the embeddings of different anchor nodes apart.

The evaluation of GROC is conducted on several popular transductive node classification datasets. The preliminary results show that GROC improves the robustness against adversarial attacks while maintaining a comparable performance on clean examples.
