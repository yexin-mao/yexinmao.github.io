This paper proposes an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, the method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or “views”) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, they use a “swapped” prediction mechanism where they predict the code of a view from the representation of another view.   

More precisely, a code is computed from an augmented version of the image and this code is predicted from other augmented versions of the same image. Given two image features zt and zs from two different augmentations of the same image, their codes qt and qs are computed by matching these features to a set of K prototypes {c1 , . . . , cK }. A “swapped” prediction is then setup measurings the fit between features z and a code q.

In addition, a new data augmentation strategy called multi-crop is proposed, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements.
