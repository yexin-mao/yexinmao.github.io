Inspired by the observation that graph data can preserve their semantics well during encoder perturbations while not requiring manual trial-and-errors, cumbersome search or expensive domain knowledge for augmentations selection, this paper proposes a novel and efficient framework SimGRACE (Simple framework for GRAph Contrastive lEarning), which does not require data augmentations. Specifically, it takes original graph as input and GNN model with its perturbed version as two encoders to obtain two correlated views for contrast. And then, it maximizes the agreement of these two views. 

This paper also proposes a novel algorithm called AT-SimGRACE to perturb the encoder in an adversarial way, which introduces less computational overhead while showing better robustness. 

The proposed methods experimentally yield competitive or better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalizability, transferability, robustness and efficiency on multiple social and biochemical graph datasets.
